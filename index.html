								<h2 class="major">Problem statement</h2>
								
								<p>"There is a need of a system capable of analysing and monitoring the water conditions of all the water bodies located
									near the villages present near SGT University campus which is located in Haryana, India. </p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Budhera village
									has population of 1575 of which 837 are males while 738 are females as per Population Census 2011 [1] therefore it
									becomes very necessary to inspect and monitor the quality of water that they are getting from these water sources, be
									it be for running some of the mundane works and chores. Moreover, village people have cows and buffaloes to raise
									and in order to clean their cattle they often use these static water resources like the Budhera Pond. Since some of the
									water bodies have become polluted or too contaminated for anyone's use, it becomes propitious to check the hydrochemistry of the water as well as monitor the depth of such bodies as far as environment and human health is
									concerned." </p>

							<h2 class="major">Solution</h2>
							<p>" We are proposing an autonomous modular boat system which will be easy to upgrade as everything that will be
								implemented will be in a different module that will make it easy to run the different operations using one boat with
								ease.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>We are proposing fabrication of the stated system into different modules:</p>
							<ul>
								<li> Module 1</li>
								<p> Depth measuring module, which will help us in calculating a significant amount of volumetric
									holdings that will help in understanding the amount of water that is wasted or polluted. </p>
								<li> Module 2</li>
								<p>Sensor assembly module, which will help us in analysing the condition of the water by finding out
									the TDS, Turbidity, pH and Dissolved Oxygen to see to what extent has the water become polluted. Or each
									parameter there are individual sensors that will be used in order to achieve this goal.
									</p>
									<ul> 
										<li>TDS, Total dissolved solids (TDS) refer to the amount of minerals, metals, organic material and salts that
											are dissolved in a certain water volume that is expressed in mg/L. It is directly associated with the quality
											and purity of water, particularly in water purification systems.
										</li>
										<li>Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water, caused predominantly by suspended materials such as
											clay, silt, organic and inorganic matter, plankton and other microscopic organisms, and scattering and
											absorbing light.
										</li>
										<li>pH, is defined as the negative logarithm of H+ ion concentration. Hence, the meaning of the name pH is
											justifying the power of the hydrogen. There is a scale for pH which tells the characteristics of water in
											terms of their acidic or basic nature.
										</li>	
										<li>Dissolved Oxygen, is the amount of the oxygen present in the water bodies, this is the oxygen which are
											required by the aquatic flora and fauna to survive and grow. 
										</li>
									</ul>
				
								<li> Module 3</li>
								<p>Boat assembly, that will keep all the motors, microcontrollers, Battery pack and electronics inside
									one big casing that will allow good waterproofing upto a certain extent.</p>

								<li> Module 4</li>
								<p> Remote sensing module, for manoeuvring the stated ROV with ease using the mobile app or a
									remote.

							<h2 class="major">Prior Research</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>There are many research papers published which state the use of ROVs for imaging, mapping and monitoring water
								pollution.
								In a paper published by Mohamad Adhipramana, Rina Mardiati and Edi Mulyana from Bandung, Indonesia
								emphasized on making a ROV robot for monitoring the quality of water based on IoT. </p>
								<h4>Their research methodologies involved:</h4>
								<blockquote>
								<ol>
									<li>Designing of the robotic system.</li>
									<li>Designing of monitoring systems.</li>
									<li>Designing software for the same</li>
								</ol>
								</blockquote>
							<p>Their ROV had a speed of 0.46 km per hour and the distance it can reach was upto 140 meters. Their ROV was
								limited to providing data of pH, NTU, & PPM [1].
								In the other paper by Liah X. Coggins and Anas Ghadoani, from University of western Australia, Crawley, Australia
								stated high resolution bathymetric mapping. From their paper it can be clearly seen that using ROV for any
								bathymetric survey or even monitoring purpose is a very good and reliable choice [2]. Their ROV had Sonar with a
								GPS module which made the ROV autonomous.
								We also got a lot of insights on how to make our prototype by reading a research article which stated the use of
								Arduino Uno to find out water turbidity measurement devices. In this paper Researchers have developed a turbidity
								measuring device using a microcontroller essentially Arduino Uno and a photoresistor sensor [3]. Going through
								these papers gave us the idea that the direction we are going in is the right one and there are a lot of resource’s online
								to make this project into a reality for the greater good of humanity.
								We also did some prior research on locating different water bodies and even visited Budhera Pond located in
								Budhera, Haryana, India</p>

							<p>In developing such a system, we are solving the issues of absence of data of such water bodies since they are small
								but can affect the areas growth and health conditions of the people residing there.</p>
							<p>Main benefit of the developing such system is to analyse and monitor the water quality and gather data to get a
								know-how about the place's water conditions that might have been affecting the lies of the people in a negative
								cartesian on a longer run or we can say it might have been leading them in increased Biomagnifications. We will be
								able to study and pitch a restoration plan of such waterbodies in future for a greater good of flora and fauna and
								humans. </p>	
							<p>This system will help in generating the action plan for revival of such water bodies in the long run affecting many
								lives.</p>	
							<p>The coupling of depth measuring module with the ROV platform has several advantages over traditional
								measurement techniques:
								<ol>
									<li>Requires less manual labour.</li>
									<li>Reduce risks and safety equipment requirements, as we can control the ROV using the remote or laptop</li>
									<li>Reduce the human error in reading and the difference in having different people conduct these types of
										surveys.</li>
									<li>It will collect many more data points as compared to a man on a boat performing the same depth measurement
										technique</li>

								</ol>
							<p>The coupling of all the modules together has certain advantages as compared to physically going on a boat and
								taking samples of water from different spots like:
								
								<ol>
									<li>Automatic updation of the reading onto the SD Card.</li>
									<li>We can pre determine the trajectory of the boat using GPS points or by pre-calculating the points using
										simulation software</li>
									<li>Can change survey time based on the requirement of no. of data points</li>
									<li>Less to no Human error in readings as the readings will be acquired by the sensors</li>
									<li>We can divide the operation area by dividing the selected water body into quadrants for ROV to survey more
										precisely.</li>
